<h2>Here is a brief summary about me:</h2>


> I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, specializing in the Electronic field, from the Technology University of Sahand. My bachelor's thesis was titled 'Design and Implementation of Active Filters Using MATLAB's Genetic Algorithm.' My interests have led me towards FPGA and Artificial Intelligence, and I have actively sought to enhance my skills in these areas, along with other essential competencies in my field. I am passionate about developing projects that align with my coursework and have participated in various activities during my academic journey, including presentations and collaborative projects.

I have experience coding in platforms like Vivado, ISE, MATLAB, ATMEL Studio, and Arduino IDE. In particular, my practical projects with FPGA include USART communication, seven-segment displays, state machine management, timers, counters, internal ROM, and module interconnections. Furthermore, Iâ€™ve also worked with the STM32F103C8T6, focusing on timers, UART communication, interrupts, and I2C protocol. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with the Atmega32A in my Digital Systems lab, where I constructed an IoT auto-car controller. Finally, I designed a PID controller circuit for a second-order plant using Sallen-Key topology, and I have a strong passion for both analog and digital systems.
